![sorting](https://semanticadigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cover-1.png)

## Description

This project is a about:
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm


## Tasks

###  0. Bubble sort 
```
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
```

###  1. Insertion sort 
```
Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
```

###  2. Selection sort 
```
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
```

###  3. Quick sort 
```
Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
```

## File Big O notation
The file Write in the file 0-#, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case
